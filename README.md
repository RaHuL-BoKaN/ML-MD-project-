Objective

Utilize ML to analyze molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of bacterial interactions with various material surfaces.
Approach

Extract features from MD simulation data like atomic distances, hydrogen bonds, and molecular descriptors.
Train classifiers (Random Forest) and regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict interaction outcomes.
Apply clustering (K-means) to identify interaction.
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall.
Use of visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Impact

Prediction of interaction outcomes for new bacteria-material systems.
Enable rapid prediction of interaction outcomes, and understanding molecular mechanisms.
